### Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
### The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
### The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
### After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

fname = input("Enter flie: ")
hand = open(fname)

di = dict()
for lin in hand:
    if not lin.startswith("From "):
        continue
    wds = lin.split()
    w = wds[1] 
    
    di[w] = di.get(w,0) + 1
     
        
largest = 0
theword = None
for k,v in di.items():
    if v > largest:
        largest = v
        theword = k
        
print(theword,largest)
